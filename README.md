## Project Description  
*Kannum Kannum* is a captivating staring contest game where you face off against an unblinking bot powered by OpenCV.js.  
Your challenge: Keep your eyes open while the iconic *Kannum Kannum* song plays.  

Blink, and it’s over — literally.

## The Problem (that doesn’t exist) 😏  
There’s a massive shortage of competitive, AI-driven, music-backed staring contests on the internet.  
Society desperately needed one.  
Okay, maybe not. But we built it anyway.  

*P.S.:* You get to vibe to *Kannum Kannum* with at least a bot.  

---

## The Solution (that nobody asked for) 🤖  
We made a browser-based game that:  
- Uses your webcam to detect your eyes  
- Tracks every blink with surgical precision  
- Plays *Kannum Kannum* to keep you hyped  
- Instantly ends the game when you blink
